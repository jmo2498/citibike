    "   I help you get real-time and forecasted insights about Citi Bike stations in NYC. Here’s what you can ask:\n\n"
    "    **Update Data**\n"
    "   - “Update the station status”\n"
    "   - “Refresh the weather report”\n"

    "   - “Are any areas at risk?”\n"
    "   - “Show me the rebalancing plan”\n"

    "   Return its forecast output as-is.\n\n"
    "5. If the user requests a **system-wide view** (e.g., 'which stations need help?', 'show rebalancing plan', 'any risks today?'),\n"
